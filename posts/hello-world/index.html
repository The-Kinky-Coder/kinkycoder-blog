          <p>Here's the thing. I will often post wall of texts on places like Bluesky. Shocking, I know! The problem is Bluesky isn't designed for long form content. That's not a bad thing just a fact. Problem is when I want to rant or make a LONG post then well it's not the best place to put it. That is one of the reason I decided to make a blog, or something like a blog.</p>
          <p>I'll be using this place as somewhere I can write at length about things, or just put some thoughts down, or just rant about things, or talk about the projects I'm working on.</p>
          <p>So yeah. Welcome I guess! (waves)</p>
