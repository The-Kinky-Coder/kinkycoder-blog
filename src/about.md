# About Me

I'm just a kinky coder. I like to code and I like kink, so the name seemed rather fitting!

Dunno what I will post about yet. Probably just my thoughts, ramblings, and project progress. ADHD and Autism tend to mean that my interests tend to bounce around. I can get highly focused on a single project, spend weeks on it and basically treat it like it's the only thing that matters in the whole world, than the next day, poof, interest for it has waned, and I need to focus on something else for a while, only for that interest to bounce back with a vengeance later on.

That is to say that is posts die off, I'm probably hyper focused on something else right now! But I'm trying to make myself post about once a week with things that I find fun, interesting, need to rant, etc. etc. etc.!
